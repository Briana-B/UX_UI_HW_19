        <h1>How I Got Into UX</h1>
        <div class="heroInfo heroBody">
        <p> As a child I would spend hours watching my father code. He has been a software engineer my whole life, and it always     seemed so demanding. But the joy he would have when he made a complex system work was immeasurable. I wanted to do       something within the field, but I have always had a passion for art and wanted a profession that would focus both on     logic and creativity. 
            <br>
            <br>
        
            I started teaching myself to code simple HTML websites with CSS. It was going great, but I just didn’t know how to apply it. This started my research into the world of tech careers, and I finally landed upon UX/UI Design. Any profession that could eventually land to a “unicorn” role sounded like a perfect fit. I decided to join the University of Denver’s UX/UI Bootcamp and graduate September 2021. I have learned so much about design thinking, user research, visual design, usability testing, and prototyping--and there’s so much more to learn as the field is constantly changing! I want to build new, innovative designs that are human-centric. And eventually become a “unicorn”.
